My github account is basically a new account that features a public repository named after my username. There is no profile icon as of yet or much activity. 
The repository I created is new and empty besides this readme file. 
To clone my repository I opened up the GitHub Desktop, signed in to my account, went to the "Clone Repository" option and selected my newly created repository and set the destination to my class folder on my desktop.
